# Voter Turnout in New York State

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates a data analysis pipeline that performs Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations and advanced analysis on a hypothetical dataset related to voting demographics and electoral participation using Python.

**Data Science Solution**
Generating synthetic data to analyze voter turnout across different counties in New York State and to understand the demographic factors, such as age, income, and education level, that influence voting behavior.

**Impact Solution**
- Recommendations for data-driven policy adjustments to ensure equitable voting access and compliance with the New York Voting Rights Act.
- A report on the findings, highlighting key anomalies and potential areas of concern that may prevent specific groups from voting.

**Next Steps in the study**
- Address data imbalance using class weights or resampling techniques.
- Train models that can handle imbalanced data, such as Random Forest or XGBoost.
